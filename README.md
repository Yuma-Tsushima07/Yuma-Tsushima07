# <samp> Hello everyone </samp>






## <samp> Chess Match </samp>
I love playing a game of chess, would you all like to play a match together? If so: move a <!-- BEGIN TURN -->?<!-- END TURN --> piece.

<!-- BEGIN CHESS BOARD -->
`(Here goes the chess board)`
<!-- END CHESS BOARD -->

`It's your turn to move! Choose one from the following table`
<!-- BEGIN MOVES LIST -->
(List of moves to play)
<!-- END MOVES LIST -->
